# Typescript Template

This is a template for creating Typescript projects.

This template will help you start a Typescript project without needing to worry about any configuration.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn` or `npm i`

Installs every dependency needed for the project.

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
The app will reload every time you save a file.

You will also see any lint errors/warnings in the console.

> _`yarn dev` and `npm run dev` do the same._

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

> _`yarn prod` and `npm run prod` do the same, and also run the app after building it._

### `yarn lint` or `npm run lint`

Runs the linter and logs every error and warning to the console.

> _`yarn lint:fix` and `npm run lint:fix` fix every autofixable error/warning._


### `yarn publish` or `npm publish`

Publish your app to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

> _The linter will be run before publishing the package._
